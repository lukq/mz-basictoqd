This application transforms a BASIC program text for Sharp MZ-800 computer into a data file on a Quick Disk image or on a cassette tape. It can be used to easily input a large program into an emulator of the MZ-800 computer.

## Transferring the BASIC program text

Open the BASIC to QD application. The text area is prefilled with a short demonstration program. You can use it to test that the transfer works correctly, or you can replace it with your own program. Choose the emulator that you want to use in the combo box below the text area. Click the Save button/link. A data file in the requested format will be saved to your computer.

Then, open a Sharp MZ-800 emulator. Load BASIC interpreter in the emulator (two BASIC versions 1Z-016 and 5Z-009 can use a QD device). Change the QD image in the emulator to the file generated by the application. Then, load the BASIC text by typing the following in the BASIC interpreter:

	LOAD"B",A

The default name of the generated program is "B", but you can change the name in the application.

The BASIC interpreter assumes that the file was previously saved using the SAVE,A command and that it is in the correct syntax. Discovering a syntax error can be tricky. If the syntax is incorrect, the line with the error will not be reported and the LOAD will just fail.
